# Work Reports STF Test Vectors

Both JSON and SCALE formats conform to the JAM ASN.1 [schema](../jam-types-asn/jam-types.asn)
and this subsystem STF specific [schema](./reports.asn).

## Authorization Pools Management

This subsystem is **not responsible** for modifying the contents of the
authorization pools, which are read-only within the scope of this STF.

Any update to the pools is delegated to the dedicated ["authorizations"](../authorizations/README.md)
subsystem, which is tasked with removing consumed items from the authorization
pools and introduce new authorizers from the authorization queue.

## Tiny Vectors

- [report_curr_rotation](./tiny/report_curr_rotation-1.json) 游릭
  - Report uses current guarantors rotation.
- [report_prev_rotation](./tiny/report_prev_rotation-1.json) 游릭
  - Report uses previous guarantors rotation.
  - Previous rotation falls within previous epoch, thus previous epoch validators
    set is used to construct report core assignment to pick expected guarantors.

  - Multiple good work reports.

  - Work report per core gas is very high, still less than the limit.
- [too_high_work_report_gas](./tiny/too_high_work_report_gas-1.json) 游댮
  - Work report per core gas is too much high.

  - Work report has many dependencies, still less than the limit.
- [too_many_dependencies](./tiny/too_many_dependencies-1.json) 游댮
  - Work report has too many dependencies.
- [no_enough_guarantees](./tiny/no_enough_guarantees-1.json) 游댮
  - Report with no enough guarantors signatures.
- [not_authorized](./tiny/not_authorized-1.json) 游댮
  - Target core without any authorizer.
- [not_authorized](./tiny/not_authorized-2.json) 游댮
  - Target core with unexpected authorizer.
- [not_sorted_guarantor](./tiny/not_sorted_guarantor-1.json) 游댮
  - Guarantors indices are not sorted or unique.

## Full Vectors

Currently, the same test cases as tiny vectors but at a larger scale.
